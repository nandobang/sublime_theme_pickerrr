# Theme Pickerrr

A Sublime Text 3 plugin for switching between installed themes.

## Why?

I often change themes in Sublime Text, and I've grown tired of editing my
settings file only for this.

## How?

Install via [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).

Use the "Theme Picker" menu to open the theme picker, or use the shortcuts:

- *Windows/Linux:* `Ctrl + Shift + C`, `Ctrl + Shift + T`
- *Mac:* `Cmd + Shift + C`, `Cmd + Shift + T`

## Compatibility

This plugin was developed and tested with Sublime Text 3 (build 3065) on OS X
10.8.5.
